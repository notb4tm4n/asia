        <h1>Impact of Climate Change on Asia</h1>
    </header>

    <main>
        <p>Climate change has impacted people across Asia in many ways, with significant variations depending on the region’s climate, geography, and economy. Here are some specific examples:</p>

        <h2>1. South Asia (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Heatwaves and Extreme Weather:</strong> Intense and prolonged heatwaves are increasingly common, particularly in India and Pakistan, leading to health crises, reduced labor productivity, and fatalities.</li>
            <li><strong>Flooding and Monsoons:</strong> Bangladesh, India, and Nepal face more intense and unpredictable monsoon rains, causing widespread flooding, damaging infrastructure, displacing communities, and threatening food security.</li>
            <li><strong>Glacial Melting in the Himalayas:</strong> The melting glaciers in the Himalayas threaten water sources for millions who depend on these glaciers for drinking water, agriculture, and hydroelectric power. This could eventually lead to water scarcity and loss of livelihood.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Rising Sea Levels:</strong> Many parts of Southeast Asia are vulnerable to sea-level rise. Coastal cities like Bangkok, Jakarta, and Ho Chi Minh City face regular flooding, leading to displacement, property damage, and increased risk of waterborne diseases.</li>
            <li><strong>Typhoons and Storm Surges:</strong> The Philippines, in particular, has seen an increase in both the intensity and frequency of typhoons. Stronger storms bring devastating impacts, such as the destruction of homes, loss of life, and disruption to agriculture.</li>
            <li><strong>Coral Reef Degradation:</strong> Warmer sea temperatures are causing coral bleaching, which affects marine biodiversity and the fishing industry, upon which many people depend for income and food.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. East Asia (China, Japan, South Korea)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Droughts and Water Scarcity:</strong> Parts of China, particularly the northern regions, are experiencing more droughts and declining water availability, impacting agriculture and urban water supplies.</li>
            <li><strong>Agricultural Impacts:</strong> Changes in temperature and rainfall are affecting food production, which is a major concern given the large populations in this region. For example, rice and wheat yields in China are facing pressure due to altered growing conditions.</li>
            <li><strong>Urban Heat Islands:</strong> Large cities like Tokyo, Seoul, and Beijing are experiencing urban heat island effects, where higher temperatures in urban areas are exacerbated by climate change, leading to increased energy consumption for cooling and related health risks.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, etc.)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Desertification:</strong> Central Asia is seeing an increase in desertification, largely due to rising temperatures and overuse of water resources. This impacts agriculture, leading to food insecurity and reduced income for farmers.</li>
            <li><strong>Glacier Melting and Water Supply:</strong> Like the Himalayas, glaciers in Central Asia’s mountains (like the Tien Shan range) are melting at an accelerated rate. This affects rivers such as the Amu Darya and Syr Darya, which are crucial for drinking water and irrigation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Overall Impact on People</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Health Risks:</strong> Across Asia, climate-related health issues, such as heat stress, respiratory issues from wildfire smoke, and diseases from contaminated water, are increasing.</li>
            <li><strong>Economic Losses:</strong> Damage to infrastructure, agriculture, and livelihoods is causing significant economic losses. People in low-income areas, particularly those relying on agriculture and fishing, are especially vulnerable.</li>
            <li><strong>Displacement and Migration:</strong> Rising sea levels, storms, and droughts are forcing people to relocate, leading to climate migration and putting additional strain on cities.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Adaptation Efforts</h2>
        <p>Efforts to adapt to these changes include creating better infrastructure, developing climate-resistant crops, and shifting to renewable energy. Still, challenges remain, especially for lower-income communities who are most at risk but often have the fewest resources to adapt.</p>
